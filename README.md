# Imagen ML Analysis

This repository contains files for pre-processing (QC, aggregating, outlier handling etc.), visualization, and analysis of the subset of the IMAGEN Consortium data that the LNCC has requested access to.

Beware, I'm likely to change file-chunking fairly often during the early stages of the project.
